# New York CitiBike DataAnalysis With Excel

### Project Goal: 

1) To better understand the behavior of Citi Bikeâ€™s customer base (both one-time users and subscribers) and how they use Citi Bikes

2) This will help us to:
   a. Identify where more bikes should be installed
   b. Create targeted marketing campaigns that will appeal to different customer segments
   
### Key Questions:

1) What are the most popular pick-up locations across the city for Citi Bike rental?
2) How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?
3) Which age group rents the most bikes?
4) How does bike rental vary across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week? 
5) Does the factor of user age impact the average bike trip duration?
